# VisionLab
VisionLab is a research-driven repository dedicated to exploring cutting-edge topics in computer vision. It includes implementations and experiments in areas such as image recognition, 3D spatial perception, and deep learning-based vision models. Projects are primarily developed using PyTorch, with a focus on practical applications and academic experimentation.

This lab serves as a sandbox for ideas ranging from traditional vision techniques to modern neural architectures, such as CNNs, transformers, and multi-view geometry-based approaches. It aims to bridge the gap between theory and real-world implementation.
