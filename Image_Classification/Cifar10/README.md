# **CIFAR-10 Multi-Model Training & Evaluation**
### Overview
This project trains and evaluates multiple deep learning models on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to compare model performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

### Dataset
CIFAR-10: 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes (50,000 train, 10,000 test) .

### Models
The following models are included : <br>
Epoches : 20
| Model       | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Epoches   |
| ----------- | -------------  | ------------- | ----------|
| ResNet18    | 98.84%         | 84.65%        | 100       |
| VGG16       | XX.XX%         | XX.XX%        | 0         |
| DenseNet121 | XX.XX%         | XX.XX%        | 0         |
