# Feature Extraction with Gabor filters & ML Image Classification
## Image Feature Extraction
### Gabor Feature Filtering
The Gabor filter, named after Dennis Gabor, was originally a signal processing and analysis method. Later, Gösta Granlund extended it to two dimensions by adding a reference orientation, and it is used for image processing applications such as texture analysis and mid-level feature extraction. Compared with the edge detection and corner detection mentioned earlier, Gabor extracts more complex patterns, such as texture, local shape or directional features.

A Gabor filter is a convolutional filter that combines a Gaussian function element with a sine wave. The Gaussian function provides locality and weights, while the sine wave term provides directionality and frequency characteristics. Originally, the sine term was written as $exp(i(2πfx′+ϕ))$, but in practical applications, we often only take the real part, i.e., the cosine term, for filtering. Therefore, the sine function is also written as $cos(2πfx′+ϕ)$ elsewhere. The input parameters g(x, y) are the image pixel coordinates, $\lambda$ represents the wavelength of the sine component, $\theta$ controls the direction, $\psi$ is the phase offset that controls the starting point of the waveform and controls symmetry and response direction, the standard deviation of the Gaussian function represents the receptive field size, and γ is the aspect ratio used to control the elliptical shape generated by the Gaussian function. After substituting all the parameters, the Gabor value is calculated for each (x, y) until the matrix values ​​are filled, thus generating a kernel. Therefore, it can be seen that there are many parameters to control what the filter is like, which can generate a large number of filter combinations.

### Sobel Edge Detection

The Sobel filter is a discrete difference operator commonly used in image processing and computer vision, primarily for edge detection. It highlights frequently changing edge regions by calculating the gradient approximation of the image's brightness function and convolving the image with horizontal and vertical kernels (masks).


## Feature Numerical Transformation
### Mean Average
It represents the central tendency of representative data, reflecting the overall level or typical value. In characteristic engineering, it is often used to summarize the overall performance over a period of time or an interval.

### Standard Deviation
This measure of data dispersion indicates greater volatility; a higher value signifies more significant fluctuations. It can be used to describe stability or variability and is an important indicator for assessing the degree of data dispersion.

### Energy
This typically refers to the sum of squares or average of squares of a signal, reflecting the signal strength or overall amplitude. It is often used in timing or signal processing characteristics to identify activity intensity or pattern differences.

### Skewness
It measures whether the data distribution is symmetrical; positive or negative skewness indicates that the tails are skewed in different directions. It helps the model understand the asymmetric characteristics of the data distribution.

### Kurtosis
Describes the peak strength and tail thickness of the distribution. Peak strength indicates that the data may have more extreme values, which is particularly helpful for detecting anomalies or risk analysis.
